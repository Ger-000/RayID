1. Stick the magnets in the inner shells (I reccomend using hot glue) oriented so that they close the inner shells hermetically. Possibly, you might meed a soldering station or similar product to melt the PLA and be able to 
make holes, join pieces, etc. 
2. Put the UV and LED pin in their corresponding holes in the upper inner shell. Connect them to the 2 and 3 pins, respectively. 
3. Insert the laser in the hole and seal it firmly. I recommend making a small hole with tape in order to make the size of the beam smaller 
and more precise. [WARNING: ALWAYS USE LASERS CAREFULLY, AND WITH APROPPRIATE EYE PROTECTION (in this case, OD>2 for appx. 650nm)] 
4. Connect the laser cathode to pin 4 and the anode to GND.
5. Stick the spectroscope in its place and solder the following pins:
  GND
  3V3
  SDA -> 20 
  SCL -> 21
6. Place all the photorresistos and seal.
