# RayID
This is an open-source tool for young learners to access gemology and further democratize this science. It allows the user to detect gems and practice with simulated lab equipment and four modes of usage: 
1. QuickID ✨: Quickly identifies the stone with an RI reading; a spectroscopy and LUVL, incandescent and SUVL colour.
2. Lab Practice (With stone) 💎: The machine scans the gemstone in order to access a database of properties, and initiates a simulated lab experience so that the user can learn to use equipment
3. Lab practice (Without stone) 🔬: Same as above, but the user selects the stone before starting
4. Quiz 📝: The computer selects a random stone and, with no previous information, the user accesses the virtual lab and tries to work out the identity of the stone.
